BTBot
=====

A behavior tree AI for Minecraft written in Scala. 

Currently, this only runs on version 1.5.8 using Kunii's McBot framework, which modifies the Minecraft, GuiIngame, GuiIngameMenu, and MovementInputFromOptions classes.  I have also made my own changes to McBot.java and MovementInputFromOptions.  

I use Eclipse Scala IDE 3.0.2 to develop this.
