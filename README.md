BTBot
=====

A behavior tree library for automating Minecraft written in Scala. 

This depends on Kunii's McBot framework for Minecraft 1.5.2, which modifies the Minecraft, GuiIngame, GuiIngameMenu, and MovementInputFromOptions classes.  It also relies on some non-essential modifications to McBot that I do not yet have permission to distribute.
